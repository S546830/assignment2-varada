**Tondle** is my favourite place to buy food

There is a **beach** side to this restaurant full of lights and decorations.There also be fishermen with sailing boats loading the live fishes caught from the beach into the restaurant.A mall named **Mayajaal** is infront of this beach which is famous for varieties of ceramic pots.
